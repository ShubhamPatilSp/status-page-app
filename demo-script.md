## **Part 1: The Public User Experience (2 minutes)**

### **1.1: The Public Status Page**
*   **Action:** Open the public status page for a pre-configured organization (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/apex-solutions/status`).
*   **Narration:**
    > "Welcome to the public status page for [Organization Name]. This is the central hub where customers can get real-time updates on the health of our services. As you can see, it's clean, professional, and easy to understand."

### **1.2: Understanding Service Status**
*   **Action:** Point to the list of services and their current statuses.
*   **Narration:**
    > "At a glance, users can see the status of each service—from 'Operational' to 'Major Outage.' We use intuitive icons and colors to make the information highly scannable. You can also expand each service to view its uptime history over the last 90 days, providing transparency and building trust."

### **1.3: Incident History and Updates**
*   **Action:** Scroll down to the incident history section.
*   **Narration:**
    > "When an issue occurs, we don't just update the status; we create a detailed incident report. Here, users can see a timeline of events, including when the issue was identified, what we're doing to fix it, and when it's resolved. This keeps everyone informed and reduces support tickets."

### **1.4: Subscribing for Updates**
*   **Action:** Demonstrate the email subscription form.
*   **Narration:**
    > "To stay in the loop, users can subscribe to receive email notifications for any status changes. This is a crucial feature for proactive communication during an outage."

## **Part 2: The Admin Experience (3 minutes)**

### **2.1: Secure Authentication**
*   **Action:** Navigate to the admin login page and sign in.
*   **Narration:**
    > "Now, let's switch to the admin side. Access is secured with Auth0, providing robust, industry-standard authentication."

### **2.2: The Admin Dashboard**
*   **Action:** Show the main dashboard after logging in.
*   **Narration:**
    > "This is the admin dashboard, the command center for managing the status page. From here, admins can manage their organization, services, incidents, and team members."

### **2.3: Service Management**
*   **Action:** Navigate to the 'Services' tab. Create a new service and then update its status.
*   **Narration:**
    > "Adding a new service is simple. Just provide a name and description, and it's instantly live on the public page. Let's simulate an issue by changing the status of our new service to 'Degraded Performance.'"

### **2.4: Incident Management (The Real-time Demo)**
*   **Action:** Have the public status page open in a separate window. Navigate to the 'Incidents' tab and create a new incident related to the service status change.
*   **Narration:**
    > "To keep our users informed, let's create an incident. We'll give it a title and an initial update. Now, watch the public page—the moment I save this, it appears in real-time, without needing to refresh the page. This is powered by WebSockets, ensuring instant communication."

*   **Action:** Add a new update to the incident and then resolve it.
*   **Narration:**
    > "As we work on the problem, we can post updates. Each update is timestamped and appears instantly. Once the issue is fixed, we'll mark the incident as 'Resolved.' This automatically updates the service status back to 'Operational' and provides a complete, transparent history for our users."

### **2.5: Team and Organization Management**
*   **Action:** Briefly show the 'Teams' and 'Organization' settings.
*   **Narration:**
    > "StatusTrack also supports multi-user collaboration through team management and allows for easy updates to organization details, ensuring the status page always reflects the correct branding and information."

The backend is a high-performance FastAPI server, connected to a MongoDB database for flexible data storage. Real-time updates are handled efficiently with Socket.IO.
